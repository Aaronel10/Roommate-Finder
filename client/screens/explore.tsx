    folder named "search" where you can create the filter component (filter.tsx)
    and profile cards (profile-card.tsx) that you will need to generate within
    profiles (profiles.tsx) component. So, this page will really just have
    profiles.tsx and filter.tsx on it and whatever else you need to add here.
    If you need to create other components please add them to the search folder
    that I already generated for you.
